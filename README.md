# Expose Variables for Figma
Easiest way to display your all of your Figma variables in file.

![](https://github.com/qurle/expose-variables/blob/master/assets/Cover.png?raw=true)

## **How to use**

**Just run it** from the Quick Actions or Plugin menu. The plugin will will create a frame with variables grouped by collections.
You made any change? Select this frame and click "Refresh variables" at the bottom of the right panel or just rerun plugin on selected layer.

## **How it works**

The plugin runs over your file's variables, renders them in each mode and carefully put them into autolayouts.

## **Problem? Idea? Kind words?**

I accept feature suggestions and ideas to improve the plugin.
